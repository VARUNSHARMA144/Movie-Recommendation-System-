# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

This project builds a personalized **Movie Recommendation System** using the [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). It uses **collaborative filtering**, **content-based filtering**, **matrix factorization (SVD)**, and a **hybrid approach** to recommend movies to users based on their preferences and ratings.
